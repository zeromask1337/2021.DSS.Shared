# Assignments for COS 418

### Environment Setup

<p>
  You need to install Go on your own machine manually. 
  There are instructions to install from source or with a 
  package installer for several operating systems at Google's Go site: 
  <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">golang.org</a>.
</p>

### Coding Style

<p>All of the code you turn in for this course should have good style.
Make sure that your code has proper indentation, descriptive comments,
and a comment header at the beginning of each file, which includes
your name, userid, and a description of the file.</p>

<p>A portion of credit for each assignment is determined by code
quality tests, using the standard tools <tt>gofmt</tt> and <tt>go
vet</tt>.  You will receive full credit for this portion if all files
submitted conform to the style standards set by <tt>gofmt</tt> and the
report from <tt>go vet</tt> is clean (that is, produces no errors).
If your code does not pass the <tt>gofmt</tt> test, you should
reformat your code using the tool. You can also use the <a
href="https://github.com/qiniu/checkstyle">Go Checkstyle</a> tool for
advice to improve your code's style, if applicable.  Additionally,
though not part of the graded cheks, it would also be advisable to
produce code that complies with <a
href="https://github.com/golang/lint">Golint</a> where possible. </p>
